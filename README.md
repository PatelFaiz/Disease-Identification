# Disease-Identification
Disease Identification Using Machine Learning

It takes symptoms as an input and predicts the disease as an output.
<ul>
<li>We have covered total 41 diseases and 132 symptoms.</li>
<li>The project is built using machine learning.</li>
<li>Used Naive Bayes algorithm to train model.</li>
<li>The accuracy of the machine learning model is 1 i.e 100%</li>
